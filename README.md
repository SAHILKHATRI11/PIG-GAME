PIG GAME

OVERVIEW
Pig Game is a simple dice game where players take turns to roll a dice and accumulate points. The objective is to be the first player to reach 100 points. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current score and it becomes the other player's turn. Players can also choose to "hold" their score to add their current score to their total score and then pass the turn to the other player.
